DATABASE STRUCTURE
safety when remote fails


push local
push remote	-fail
	save in a local missing table

??
Does it matter from where pinger goes when saving to remote database?

THIS!
id√©a:
1 save local
2 check remote connectivity (done earlier in code)
	*offline = save in local db (missing_values)
	online = check missing values?
		clear = save to remote - end
		missing = save missing + recent
			if dbs in sync
				delete missing flagged (local)
3 fail events? write logfile local




NOT THIS	
alt
1 save local
2 once a day
	check remote data
		fill up if missing

(compare using local timestamp)

doable
